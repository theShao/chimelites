Uncouple sampling frequency from led update frequency?
tidy fft for graphic equalizer https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=35838&p=454041


Time domain energy of sinewave e = N(AMP^2)/2
       If all energy is in sine wave, goertzal output p = (AMP*N/2)^2
       So we would expect p = e*(N/2) if tone is present              

       So by comparing power in signal to power from goertzal filter 
       we can make decide if tone is presnet.  The sweep results from
       Test2/pgoertzal.m indicate the power is 10dB (linear 0.1) down
       at the edges of the detection mask.


	   
        #time_domain_energy = sum([sample ** 2 for sample in samples])   


def read_ain(i):    
    global bus
    bus.write_byte(0x48, i)
    bus.read_byte(0x48)#first 2 are last state, and last state repeated.
    bus.read_byte(0x48)
    return bus.read_byte(0x48)

while(True):
    print(chr(27) + "[2J")
    print(read_ain(0))
    print(read_ain(1))
    print(read_ain(2))
    print(read_ain(3))
    time.sleep(0.25)
